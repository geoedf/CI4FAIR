    "1. A GeoEDF workflow combines _instances_ of connector or processor classes. The YAML syntax enables the user to specify bindings for the class arguments for the connector or processor (e.g., url, user, shapefile, etc.).\n",
    "2. Filters enhance the generality of connectors. In this specific case, HDF data for a specific time period can be acquired by modifying the _DateTimeFilter_ appropriately. Similarly, wildcards ('*') in the _PathFilter_ enable search across all the files hosted in that directory on the repository.\n",
    "3. Filters essentially provide one or more binding values for variables referenced in other connectors or filters. For example, the _filename_ variable in the _NASAInput_ connector is bound by the _PathFilter_; and the _dtstring_ variable in _PathFilter_ is bound by the _DateTimeFilter_.\n",
    "3. Numeric indices are used to denote the workflow step and establish output-input linkages between steps. \n",
    "4. Fields left blank (for e.g., _password_) are instantiated at workflow execution time by prompting the user to specify a value."
